## Overview
The Emissary platform currently supports the entire spectrum of OpenAI models.
You can select one or more models from the list and simultaneously compare your prompt across different systems.

Aggregated statistics enable you to then compare performance across systems.

### Model Migrations

OpenAI and other LLM providers regularly deprecate old systems in favour of new ones.
As such, you can select both the old and new models (select specific names with dates to be sure) and compare the performance of your prompts across these systems.
