## Overview

Prompt templates are structured, pre-defined outline that serve as the static backdrop of a prompt query (input) to a language model.

A prompt template comprises prompt instructions, variables, and context. Currently, our evaluation platform supports only the former two (support for the third is incoming!).
Prompt instructions are written in raw string, while variables are wrapped in curly braces.

For an example, see below:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/sample_prompt.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

Here, the first line is the instruction, while line 2 contains the content variable that will correspond to dynamic input.
