## Overview
Once you have a clear idea of your AI use-case, you'll want to develop systems that 'adapt' to your specific needs.
This can be achieved through finetuning your own AI models. At its core, all AI is about matrix multiplication, expressed by the simple equation Ax = y where A is your AI model weights, x your input and y output.
In the case of prompting, we modify x, having no control over A. In finetuning, you modify and control A, allowing greater control and stability over your AI.
Finetuning allows you to be more than just another prompt wrapper and have differentiated AI capabilities. 

See [Finetuning your first AI model](#finetuning-your-first-ai-model) to get started, or learn more about each stage by clicking on a card below

## Finetuning your first AI model

**Step 1: Create Model Service** <br></br>
Click the + sign on the Model service panel in the dashboard and enter a name and optionally description for your finetuning task

</CardGroup>

**Step 2: Upload Datasets** <br></br>
A tile is created for your task. Click 'Manage' to enter the task workspace. Then, click 'Manage Datasets' in the 'Datasets' tile and the 'Upload Datasets' button.
Here, you can upload as many datasets as you want - remember to select a file and name each dataset. We recommend naming datasets to reflect what's distinct about them.

**Step 3: Finetune Model** <br></br>
Now, go back one panel and click into 'Manage Training Jobs'. Here, we'll be able to kick off finetunes. The shortest path to finetuning a model is click 'New Training Job', name the output model, pick a backbone and training dataset (you must have uploaded it in the step before), and click 'Train'
You can optionally upload a test data set and once you select a model, will also be able to see and modify advanced parameters such as number of epochs, learning rate, batch size and downsample size.
To test on a random fraction of your data, simply change downsample size to the relevant percentage (10 --> training on 10% of data). By default, values are set to help you have the highest probability of successful outcome. 

Note, your training job will initially show 'Pending' status - at this point, we're provisioning your instance. 
Once your training job has been initiated, you'll see 'Running' appear as the status. 
Once complete, you'll see 'success'.

**Step 4: Deploy Model** <br></br> 
Once your training job is successful, you can see the outputted models in the Artifacts tab. By clicking into 'Manage Artifacts', you can instantly see all trained models for a given Model Service and deploy them in one click, by clicking the 'Deploy' button.
You can deploy multiple models at the same time.

**Step 5: Deployment Testing and Monitoring** <br></br>
By clicking into the 'Manage Deployments', you can view, manage and test all your models - and also see the data flowing through them.
From this panel, you can also deploy base models (non-finetuned models) for any model service.
